Ingredients

    1 small knob of unsalted butter
    ½ tablespoon olive oil
    160 g cooked sliced higher-welfare ham
    2 large free-range eggs
    GREEN CHILLI & HERB SALSA
    2 small green chillies
    a few sprigs of fresh mixed herbs, such as flat-leaf parsley, tarragon, basil, mint, dill, marjoram, chives
    6 tablespoons olive oil
    1 teaspoon cider vinegar
    ½ a lime

Method
For the salsa, deseed and finely chop the chilli and place in a bowl. Pick, finely chop and add the herbs. Add the oil and vinegar, squeeze in the lime juice and mix together, then set aside.

Heat the butter and oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the ham slices. Immediately break the eggs over the ham and fry for 3 to 4 minutes or until the eggs are cooked to your liking.

Season lightly, then serve immediately with the green chilli and herb salsa drizzled on top.
